# subversive-svnkit-1.10

Quick&amp;Dirty patch of Subversive SVNKit connector to work with SVNKit 1.10

Update site: http://schierlm.github.io/subversive-svnkit-1.10/update-site/

**WARNING:** Some (proxy- and auth-related) parts of [`SVNClientEx17.java`](./src/org/polarion/team/svn/connector/svnkit/SVNClientEx17.java)
have been commented out, since I do not need them and could not quickly find where they moved in latest SVNKit version. 
Use at your own risk.
